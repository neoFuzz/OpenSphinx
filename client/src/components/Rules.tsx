              <h5>Objective</h5>
              <p>Eliminate your opponent's Pharaoh by hitting it with a laser beam.</p>

              <h5>Setup</h5>
              <p>Each player starts with pieces on placed on the 8x10 board. The active player's laser is located at the right corner of their side.</p>

              <h5>Turn Structure</h5>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Move or Rotate:</strong> Move one piece in any direction (up/down/left/right/diagonally) to an adjacent empty square, OR rotate a piece 90째 clockwise or counterclockwise</li>
                <li><strong>Fire Laser:</strong> The laser automatically fires after you make your move</li>
              </ol>

              <h5>Pieces</h5>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pharaoh:</strong> The king piece - if hit by laser, you lose!</li>
                <li><strong>Pyramid:</strong> Reflects laser at 90째 angle based on its orientation. It is destroyed if hit on a non-mirrored surface</li>
                <li><strong>Djed:</strong> Reflects laser 90째 on both sides and can not be destroyed. Can swap positions with Pyramid pieces</li>
                <li><strong>Anubis:</strong> Blocks laser completely on the front but is destroyed when hit on any other side <i>(2.0 Rules)</i></li>
                <li><strong>Obelisk:</strong> Blocks laser completely but is destroyed when hit. Starts in stacks of two, which can move together or be split <i>(Classic Rules)</i></li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Laser Rules</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Laser travels in straight lines until it hits a piece or board edge</li>
                <li>Pyramids reflect the laser at 90째 angles</li>
                <li>Anubis, Obelisks and Pharaohs stop the laser</li>
                <li>If laser hits a piece, that piece is destroyed (except Djed or Anubis' front)</li>
              </ul>

              <h5>Winning</h5>
              <p>The game ends when a laser beam hits and destroys the opponent's Pharaoh.</p>
